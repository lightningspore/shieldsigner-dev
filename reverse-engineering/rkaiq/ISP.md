# ISP startup reconstruction

The Rust replacement continues to use the Luckfox SDK's Linux ISP/sensor drivers and physical ISP hardware. The proprietary userspace RKAIQ library chooses calibrated parameters, configures the graph/queues, and runs the automatic control algorithms. Replacing that library requires all of those responsibilities; a frame captured from an already initialized pipeline does not establish independent startup.

## Recovered ISP pad setup

`isp_pipeline::setup` reconstructs `CamHwIsp20::setupPipelineFmtIsp`, ELF `0x2319c` (Ghidra `0x3319c`). The hardware prepare method invokes the higher-level `setupPipelineFmt` before entering prepared state. This pad helper is one part of prepare, not the complete initialization procedure.

| Order | Native operation | Record behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Set raw TX format | Skipped for shared CIF unless this is its first capture owner |
| 2 | Set raw RX format | Always called |
| 3 | Optional scaler format | Calls pixel-format-to-bpp helper, then scaler with input selection |
| 4 | Get ISP ACTIVE format, pad 0 | Device response supplies existing bus-format fields |
| 5 | Set pad 0 format | Replaces width/height/bus-code from sensor; preserves other returned bytes |
| 6 | Set ACTIVE crop, pad 0 | Copies input rectangle, zeroes flags/reserved fields initially |
| 7 | Set ACTIVE crop, pad 2 | Resets target/origin, restores requested width/height; preserves other fields returned by the preceding call |
| 8 | Get ISP ACTIVE format, pad 2 | Gets the source format independently |
| 9 | Set pad 2 format | Uses width/height returned by the source-crop call; preserves other source-format fields |

Driver-adjusted crop responses matter. The native method passes mutable records to device methods. Rust preserves those mutations rather than assuming the requested source dimensions were accepted. Sink width/height/code and source width/height changes are byte copies; the helper does not invent color-space values. The first nonzero ISP-device result stops subsequent calls and is returned, including a positive nonzero result. Raw-stream and scaler return values are not checked by this native helper. This behavior is recovered, not a recommendation for the final service's error policy.

The Rust backend trait exposes these operations explicitly. **There is no live backend for this helper yet.** `numeric-fixture` supplies controlled driver records and records each call. Kernel UAPI cross-compilation independently checks 88-byte format/64-byte selection layouts, field offsets, ACTIVE/CROP constants and get/set ioctl numbers.

`mise run camera:rust:isp-pipeline` executes the original ARM method and compares normalized call traces, every byte passed to set-format/selection/scaler methods and return status across 1,000 cases. Shared-CIF flags, optional scaler, all six ISP-call failure positions, positive/negative failures and adjusted driver selections are covered. Original context, input selection and sensor format must remain unchanged. Device methods, raw-stream helpers, bpp lookup and scaler are **recorded boundary stubs**, not recovered implementations proved by this test. Uninitialized bytes of get-format requests beyond which/pad are excluded. [Reference report](isp-pipeline-equivalence.json).

## Initial parameter buffer is a separate requirement

The pinned open kernel sources establish the following:

- `rkisp_params_vb2_queue_setup` establishes first-parameter state, with a separate `first_cfg_params` branch.
- When `first_params` is set, `rkisp_params_vb2_buf_queue` copies the first submitted buffer through `save_first_param`, marks `is_first_cfg`, completes that buffer and wakes `sync_onoff`. It returns before the normal per-frame parameter-list enqueue.
- ISP32 `rkisp_save_first_param_v32` copies that configuration into the saved ISP32 parameter record and allocates internal buffers required by its enabled modules.
- `rkisp_params_first_cfg_v32` checks update masks and applies measurement/other-module configuration and enables. Empty configuration/update masks produce a missing-initial-IQ warning; formats alone do not supply calibrated IQ settings.

Both downloads are SHA-pinned in `artifacts.json` and cached through `camera:re:prepare`.

These observations identify a required startup mechanism. They do not yet establish a complete userspace queue/stream order for our service, nor prove that a zeroed or partial parameter buffer will produce useful images.

## Remaining startup work

The native Ghidra exports now include hardware `init`, `prepare`, `start`, `setupPipelineFmt`, CIF/ISP format helpers and parameter submission. The next implementation work is to connect the format/link setup to real device adapters, recover calibrated initial module configuration, implement parameter queue ownership/lifetime, synchronize it with statistics/image streams, and reproduce restart/cleanup. AWB/gain parameter serializers and statistics capture already exist separately; they do not constitute full initialization. Real hardware must then validate cold boot without a vendor bootstrap, frame quality, exposure/WB response and restart behavior.

For focused exports, `ExportRkaiq.java` accepts an optional second argument containing a Java full-match symbol regex. Its default selection remains unchanged. Exported pseudocode stays in ignored tool caches and is not distributed in the test kit.
